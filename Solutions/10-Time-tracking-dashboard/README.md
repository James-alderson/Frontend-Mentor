## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor
- [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - CSS Reset
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - Methodology

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned to use the ‚Äç`BEM` methodology for naming html elements.

Methodology `BEM` was invented at Yandex to develop sites which should be launched fast and supported for a long time. It helps to create extendable and reusable interface components.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="dashboard">
  <div class="dashboard__card dashboard__card--user">
    <div class="dashboard__user-info">
      <img src="assets/images/image-jeremy.png" alt="Jeremy Robson" width="70" height="70">
      <div class="dashboard__user-text">
        <span class="dashboard__report dashboard__report--text">Report for</span>
        <h1 class="dashboard__report dashboard__report--user-name">Jeremy Robson</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="dashboard__content dashboard__content--user">
      <div class="dashboard__timeframes">
        <button id="timeframeDaily" class="dashboard__btn">Daily</button>
        <button id="timeframeWeekly" class="dashboard__btn dashboard__btn--active">Weekly</button>
        <button id="timeframeMonthly" class="dashboard__btn">Monthly</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  ...
</section>
```

In this challenge, I learned to use the `min()` css function.

The `min()` CSS function lets you set the smallest (most negative) value from a list of comma-separated expressions as the value of a CSS property value.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.dashboard {
	display: grid;
	width: min(calc(100vw - 1rem), size(dashboard-small));
	gap: 1.5rem;
	margin: 1rem 0.5rem;
  ...
}
```

In this challenge, I learned to use the `arguments object` in javaScript.

`arguments` is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function getReports(idValue) {
  let responseStatus = 0
  buttonStatus(responseStatus)
  fetch(DATA_URL)
    .then(response => {
      responseStatus = response.status
      buttonStatus(responseStatus)
      return response.json()
    })
    .then(data => {
      setReports(data, idValue)
    })
}
```
